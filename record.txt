There are two method to extract keywords.
First, we can use HanLP.extractKeywords(),second , we can use HanLP.extractPhrases().
By the way ,as the same remark, different may lead to different result.

For this one :肾宝，资格的正品好药，吃了效果好，这是第二次买这个宝宝了！！！
extractKeywords():[正品, 效果, 资格, 宝宝, 肾宝]
extractPhrases():[资格正品] maybe , it seems more like a remark-tag.

For this one : 质量好，服务好，物流快，全五分。。
extractKeywords(): [物流, 质量, 服务, 全五分]
extractPhrases(): [] is null .

So , it's better to take extractKeywords() to finish the lexicon.

We use the method getKeywords to get the word and calculate the word frequency.

As the construct of the lexicon , we use the field "statue" to tag each class.
like:
0 for logistical , 1 for quality ,  2 for service ,3 for negative remark ,
4 for pretty , 5 for neutral remark .
